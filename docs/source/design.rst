Design Notes
============

This section describes miscellaneous information about the design of payu.


Model and Experiment Layout
===========================

Laboratory Structure
---------------------

An experiment requires that the model executable, configuration, and data files
be staged in the appropriate directories, outlined below:

Control Path
   Configuration files are stored here, and is also the directory where
   ``payu`` is invoked. This is usually the current working directory.

Laboratory Path
   This is the top-level directory for a particular model, and contains the
   model executables, input data, and model output for all experiments using
   this model. The default directory is ``/scratch/${PROJECT}/${USER}/${MODEL}``.

Herein, ``${LAB}`` refers to the laboratory path.

Executable Path
   Model executables are stored here. The default is ``${LAB}/bin``.

Input Path
   Data files are stored here. The default is ``${LAB}/input``.

Codebase Path (*not currently supported*)
   The sourcecode of the current active executable will be stored in this
   directory. The default is ``${LAB}/codebase``.

Archive Path
   Model output is stored in this directory, separated by experiment. For an
   experiment named ``myrun``, the archived output is stored in
   ``${LAB}/archive/myrun/output000``, ``output001``, ``output002``, etc. and
   restart information is stored in ``restart000``, ``restart001``, etc.

Work Path
   Experiments that are actively running are stored in the work path. For an
   experiment named ``myrun``, the default directory is ``${LAB}/work/myrun``.

.. _experiment-steps:
Experiment Steps
================

Payu runs through several steps to setup, run and clean-up an experiment, outlined below:

init
   Experiment initialization runs first, and includes reading in configuration information and updating the metadata.

setup
   Setup creates the ephemeral work directory and updates manifests. It is what is run with the ``payu setup`` command. 

run
   This is the step which does any automated ``runlog`` commands (``git commit``) and executes the model.

error
   The error stage is entered if the model runs but returns an error code.

archive
   If the model run is succesful, payu archives the results from the work directory to the output directories.


Style Guide
===========

These are various unorganised notes on preferred coding style for payu.  While
it's unlikely that every file adheres to this style, it should generally be
adopted where possible.

1. All files should adhere to PEP8 rules.  In particular, no warnings should be
   reported by ``pycodestyle`` using default settings.

2. Docstrings should similarly adhere to PEP257, as reported by ``pydocstyle``.
   (Currently conformance to this rule is admittedly very poor.)

   In particular, ``help()`` should be readable and well-formatted for every
   module and function.

3. Imports should be one per line (as in PEP8), and ideally alphabetical (as
   recommended by PyLint).  Additionally, we separate these into three groups
   with a blank line, and in this order:

   a. Future statements

   b. Standard library modules

   c. Dependencies

   d. Modules local to the project

   Example import::

      from __future__ import print_function

      import os
      import shlex
      import sys

      import requests
      import yaml

      import payu.envmod

4. Modules should not be renamed.  This is bad::

      import numpy as np

   This is good::

      import numpy

   The reason here is to preserve shorter names for other uses in the code.
   But, as usual, the `HHGP's section on modules`_ explains this better than I
   can within a bullet point list.

   (Also note that this is another rule with poor conformance.)

5. Multiple equivalence checks should use tuples.  This is bad::

      if x == 'a' or x == 'b':

   This is good::

      if x in ('a', 'b'):
